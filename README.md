# 🧬 CMML3_ICA2: Benchmarking scAtlasVAE for Single-cell Integration of Bone Marrow Datasets

This project benchmarks the performance of **scAtlasVAE**, **scVI**, and **Harmony** for single-cell RNA-seq data integration. Using bone marrow single-cell datasets with batch effects, we evaluate how well each method removes batch artifacts while preserving cell type structure.
